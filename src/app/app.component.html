	<app-featured book_name="Uzumaki: Spiral into Horror" author_name="Junji Ito" image_source="Images/ji8.jpeg">
		<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzumaki -->
		<p> 
            Uzumaki is a Japanese horror manga series written and illustrated by Junji Ito. The series tells the story of the citizens of Kurouzu, a fictional city 
			which is plagued by a supernatural curse involving spirals. The story for Uzumaki originated when Ito attempted to write a story about people living 
			in a very long terraced house, and he was inspired to use a spiral shape to achieve the desired length. Ito believes the horror of Uzumaki is effective 
			due to its subversion of symbols which are positively portrayed in Japanese media, and its theme of protagonists struggling against a mysterious force 
			stronger than themselves. Uzumaki continues to receive critical acclaim, deemed by many as Ito's magnum opus.
